This is a simple demonstration of a blockchain written in Go. Note that it does not actually integrate into any blockchain networks nor does it handle crypto mining. This shows the simple basic building blocks that are available in a blockchain network and how they interact with each other.

A blockchain is a distributed ledger that consists of a chain of blocks linked together. They provide benefits such as decentralization, transparency, and enhanced security through cryptographic algorithms.

A block is a fundamental blockchain unit that contains a single or a set of transactions or digital records. Each block contains a unique hash generated from its data and the previous blockâ€™s hash, forming an immutable chain.

## Requirements

This uses Go 1.22 which can be downloaded from [here](https://go.dev/doc/install), that should/is the only requirement for running this project :).

## Running & testing the project

Running tests can be done using [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/):

``` shell
make test
```

Tests can be run with coverage using:

``` shell

make test-coverage
```

Running the project can be done with:

```shell
go run cmd/main.go
```

Which should print out something like:

```plain
Alice's wallet created successfully
Bob's wallet created successfully
Alice to Bob Transaction created successfully
Transaction Verified Successfully
