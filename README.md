# GoChain

A blockchain is a distributed ledger that consists of a chain of blocks linked together. They provide benefits such as decentralization, transparency, and enhanced security through cryptographic algorithms.

A block is a fundamental blockchain unit that contains a single or a set of transactions or digital records. Each block contains a unique hash generated from its data and the previous blockâ€™s hash, forming an immutable chain.
