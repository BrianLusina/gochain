// Package wallet will contain the logic for managing user wallets.
// In blockchain, a wallet is a digital container that stores the cryptographic keys used to access and manage a userâ€™s assets.
// It consists of a private key and a public key. The public key is shared within the blockchain network and is mainly used to receive funds and verify the authenticity of digital signatures.
// With a public key, anyone can encrypt data that can only be decrypted by the corresponding private key. The private key is a secret cryptographic key that should be kept secure and known only to the owner.
// It creates digital signatures, signs transactions, and decrypts data encrypted with the corresponding public key.
